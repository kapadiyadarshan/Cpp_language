/*
    WAP to abstract some attributes of class Admin to
    prevent them to be inherited by its child classes.
    - Class Admin -> Class Manager
    - Class Manager -> Class Employee
    - Class Admin has following members:
    - company_name
    - manager_salary
    - employee_salary
    - total_staff
    - total_annual_revenue
    - can_terminate
    - use all attributes accessibility in parent class and
    child class properly.
    - override a method myAccess() in both child
    classes to display all parent classâ€™s members value
    accordingly.
