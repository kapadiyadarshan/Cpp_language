/*
    Build a Counter App in C++ using OOP concept.
    Initially the counter meant to be set as a value 0 using
    constructor. By pressing UP Arrow from keyboard, counter
    will be increment and by pressing DOWN Arrow, counter
    will be decrement. You can use ASCII value concept by
    achieving this type of functionality at the execution
    time of a Program.
